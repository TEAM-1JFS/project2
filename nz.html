<p>Tourism in New Zealand comprised an important sector of the national economy â€“ tourism directly contributed NZ$16.2
    billion (or 5.8%) of the country's GDP in the year ended March 2019. As of 2016 tourism supported 188,000
    full-time-equivalent jobs (nearly 7.5% of New Zealand's workforce). The flow-on effects of tourism indirectly
    contributed a further 4.3% of GDP (or NZ$9.8 billion). Despite the country's geographical isolation, spending by
    international tourists accounted for 17.1% of New Zealand's export earnings (nearly NZ$12 billion). International
    and domestic tourism contributed, in total, NZ$34 billion to New Zealand's economy every year as of 2017.

    New Zealand markets itself abroad as a "clean, green" adventure-playground (Tourism New Zealand's main marketing
    slogan, "100% Pure New Zealand", reflects this), emphasising as typical tourist destinations nature areas such as
    Milford Sound, Abel Tasman National Park and the Tongariro Alpine Crossing; while activities such as bungee jumping
    or whale watching exemplify typical tourist attractions, marketed primarily to individual and small-group
    travellers. Australia provides by far the largest group of New Zealand's international tourists (about 45%), due to
    its close proximity (three to four hours by plane) and traditional good relations. Mainland China, the United States
    and the United Kingdom are the next three largest markets.


    The Sky Tower, a popular attraction in Auckland, serves as an observation tower as well as featuring a revolving
    restaurant.
    The vast majority of international tourist arrivals to New Zealand come through Auckland Airport, which handled 11.5
    million international passengers in 2019.Two per cent of visitors arrived by sea as of 2009.Many
    international tourists spend time in Auckland, Christchurch, Queenstown, Rotorua, and Wellington. Other
    high-profile destinations include the Bay of Islands, the Waitomo Caves, Aoraki / Mount Cook, and Milford Sound.
    Many tourists travel considerable distances through the country during their stays, typically using coach lines or
    hired cars. Though some destinations have seasonal specialities (for winter sports, for example), New Zealand's
    southern-hemisphere location offers attractions for off-peak northern-hemisphere tourists chasing or avoiding
    certain seasons. In June 2018 the New Zealand government announced the imposition of a "tourist tax" of around NZ$25
    to NZ$35 for international visitors, excluding Australians, many Pacific islanders, and young children. It planned
    to implement this taxation in 2019 through a newly proposed electronic travel-registration process.</p>
