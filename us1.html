    <p>The travel and tourism industry in the U.S. was among the first commercial casualties of the September 11
        attacks, a series of terrorist attacks on the U.S. Terrorists used four commercial airliners as weapons of
        destruction, all of which were destroyed in the attacks on New York City, Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania
        with nearly 3,000 deaths.In the first full week after flights resumed, passenger numbers fell by nearly 45
        percent, from 9 million in the week before September 11 to 5 million.Hotels and travel agencies received
        cancellations across the world. The hotel industry suffered an estimated $700 million loss in revenue during the
        four days following the attacks.The situation recovered over the following months as the Federal Reserve
        kept the financial system afloat. The U.S. Congress issued a $5 billion grant to the nation's airlines and $10
        billion in loan guarantees to keep them flying.

        In the U.S., tourism is either the first, second, or third largest employer in 29 states, employing 7.3 million
        in 2004, to take care of 1.19 billion trips tourists took in the U.S. in 2005.The U.S. outbound holiday
        market is sensitive in the short term, but possibly one of the most surprising results from the September 11,
        2001 attacks was that by February 2002 it had bounced back. This quick revival was generally quicker than many
        commentators had predicted only five months earlier.

        The United States economy began to slow significantly in 2007, mostly because of a real-estate slump, gas prices
        and related financial problems.Many economists believe that the economy entered a recession at the end of
        2007 or early in 2008.Some state budgets for tourism marketing have decreased, such as Connecticut which is
        facing soaring gas prices.
