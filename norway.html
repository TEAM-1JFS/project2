<p>The main attractions of Norway are the varied landscapes that extend across the Arctic Circle. It is famous for its
    fjord-indented coastline and its mountains, ski resorts, lakes and woods. Popular tourist destinations in Norway
    include Oslo, Ålesund, Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, Kristiansand, Arendal, Tromsø, Fredrikstad and Tønsberg. Much
    of the nature of Norway remains unspoiled, and thus attracts numerous hikers and skiers. The fjords, mountains and
    waterfalls in Western and Northern Norway attract several hundred thousand foreign tourists each year. In the
    cities, cultural idiosyncrasies such as the Holmenkollen ski jump in Oslo and Saga Oseberg in Tønsberg attract many
    visitors, as well as science abilities[clarification needed] and cultural learnings[clarification needed] and things
    such as Bryggen in Bergen, the Vigeland Sculpture Park in Oslo, The Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Fredrikstad
    Fortress (Gamlebyen) in Fredrikstad and the ruin park of Tønsberg Fortress in Tønsberg, and they do not know about
    it.[clarification needed]

    The culture of Norway evolved as a result of its sparse population, harsh climate, and relative isolation from the
    rest of Europe. It is therefore distinct from other countries in Europe in that it has fewer opulent palaces and
    castles, smaller agricultural areas, and longer travel distances. Regionally distinct architecture, crafts, and art
    are presented in the various folk museums, typically based on an ethnological perspective. Norsk Folkemuseum at
    Bygdøy in Oslo is the largest of these.</p>
